Farkle is a simple dice game that has captured the attention and board-game-time 
of odds-hounds everywhere.To play Farkle, all you need are six dice and a pencil 
and paper. PATCH products, the makers of Farkle would be sad, however, if you 
did not buy their dice cup.

Farkle Scorekeeper and Determining Who Goes First
Choose a scorekeeper. It is their responsibility to keep track of everyone’s 
score, so pick someone who can pay attention to detail and doesn’t cheat at 
Monopoly. Each player rolls one die, with the highest roll going first. In 
the event of a tie, the players who tied for the highest roll roll again. 
Once the first player is decided, play continues to the left.

Farkle Scoring
You cannot count any of your points until you reach at least 500 points in a 
single round. When you reach 500 points for the first time, you may choose to 
immediately end your turn to prevent losing the points.

5’s = 50 point
1’s = 100 points
1,1,1 = 300 points
2,2,2 = 200 points
3,3,3 = 300 points
4,4,4 = 400 points
5,5,5 = 500 points
6,6,6 = 600 points
Four of a Kind = 1,000 points
Five of a Kind = 2,000 points
Six of a Kind = 3,000 points
A Straight of 1-6 = 1,500 points
Three Pairs = 1,500 points
Four of a Kind + a Pair = 1,500
Two sets of Three of a Kind = 2,500

Your Turn
On your turn, place all six dice into the dice cup and roll them. If a die 
falls out of the play area, re-roll it. Take out any dice worth points after 
each roll. This forms your running score for the round. Roll the remaining 
dice, removing any dice worth points and adding them to your running total. 
If you are ever able to set aside all six dice, you may re-roll all of your 
dice and keep building your running total. If ever you are unable to set aside
 any dice (no dice are worth points), you have Farkled. You lose your running 
 point total and your turn is over.

Winning the Game
Be the first player to meet or exceed 10,000 points to start the end game 
sequence. Each other player has one turn to try to beat your score. After 
all remaining players have had their turn, the player with the highest score
wins.
